## 📖 Project Overview

**Pathfinder’s Tale** is a gamified storytelling platform where users can:
- Explore a **3D interactive globe** with pins for 23+ countries.  
- Click a country’s pin to **open a book-like view**.  
- Browse categories such as *Food*, *Activities* and *Views*.  
- Open individual **chapters** with rich stories and media.  
- Be guided by an **onboarding tour** that introduces the app step by step.
- Get **fun fact** about a country using AI.  

We built this to combine the **wonder of exploration** with the **power of storytelling**, turning geography into a playful and immersive journey.

## 🏗️ How We Used Storyblok

- **Countries stored as stories** inside Storyblok (23–24 countries).  
- Each country has **dynamic blocks** for categories (Food, Activities, etc.).  
- Some categories contain **published chapters** with sample content, which are displayed in the React app.  
- Storyblok acts as the **content backend**, letting non-developers expand or modify stories easily without touching code.  

This makes Pathfinder’s Tale **scalable**: new countries and chapters can be added directly from Storyblok without redeploying the app.
